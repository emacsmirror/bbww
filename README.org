=better-backward-word= is an Emacs package that provides alternatives to the basic built-in text editing commands =forward-word=, =backward-word=, =backward-kill-word= and =forward-kill-word=. These alternative implementations are generally less greedy, especially when the forward/backward region contains a newline.

The purpose of =better-backward-word= is to overhaul the default Emacs text editing functionality in a way that comes natural for users who are used to "normal" modern text editors.

* Suggested configuration

The package [[https://github.com/alezost/mwim.el][MWIM]] is heavily used internally, and making use of MWIM is recommended to further improve the default Emacs text editing features.
